# The-Ultimate-Sunflower

Arduino project PeiP2:

--------------------------------------------------------------------<<( TASK BOARD )>>------------------------------------------------------------------------

-Light-following (static base) robot (amusing and practical aspect)
-Aesthetic switch on and switch off
-Petals composed of solar panels
-If possible: series of LED lights on the "flower pot" that can be switched on thanks to the energy recolted by sonar panels

-- Best possible result: having a functional decoration that may serve as a source of light as well --

VIDEO OF A GOOD DEPICTION OF OUR PROJECT: (No LEDs)

Required work:

-Print pieces for the pot (hiding the majority of cables and cards), and trunk of the Sunflower.
-Buy required engines and functional pieces in order to create the robot.
-Assemble the robot.
-Write the code.
-INNOVATING ASPECT OF THE PROJECT: Find a way to implement the Leds system.
+ AESTHETIC ASPECT: Make the robot look good :)  ( Flower themed obviously )
+ CLASS WORK: Produce a compte-rendu for each Arduino session.
